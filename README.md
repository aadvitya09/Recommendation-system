# Recommendation-system


A movie recommendation system using the bag-of-words algorithm entails representing each movie and user review as a vector of word frequencies. First, preprocess reviews by tokenizing and removing stop words. Then, construct a vocabulary of unique words. For each movie, create a feature vector based on the word frequencies in its reviews. Calculate similarity between movies using cosine similarity. Finally, recommend movies to users based on the similarity between their reviewed movies and other movies in the dataset. This simplistic approach doesn't consider semantic meaning or context but can still provide basic recommendations based on textual similarities.

This system doesn't capture word order but effectively matches movies based on shared content. With larger datasets, advanced techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings can enhance recommendation accuracy by considering word importance and semantics, respectively.
